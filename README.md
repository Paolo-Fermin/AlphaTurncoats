# AlphaTurncoats

From [Milda Matilda Games](https://mildamatildagames.wordpress.com/turncoats-2/):
>Turncoats is a competitive game for 2-5 players, where three factions are at war. The players take on the role of Aspirants and Interlopers, not obviously tied to any one group. Instead, they must manage their loyalties, represented by stones in their hand that they keep hidden from everyone else.

This repository contains a Python implementation of Turncoats as well as code to train an RL agent to become the best Turncoats AI in the world.
